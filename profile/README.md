## Tech Stack

I specialize in a diverse range of technologies and programming languages, including but not limited to:

- JavaScript (Node.js, React, Vue.js)

## Development Approach

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and using best practices such as TDD (Test-Driven Development) and Agile methodologies. Collaboration is key, and I enjoy working in teams that prioritize communication and knowledge sharing. Continuous learning is at the heart of my workflow, so I'm always exploring new technologies and improving my skills.

## Interests

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about open-source contributions, hackathons, and mentoring budding developers. I also enjoy exploring the world of data science and machine learning in my spare time. In addition, I love participating in community events, sharing knowledge through blogs, and engaging in coding challenges.
